<p> ♡ dear jasmine, ♡ <br> 
i love your hair (especially when you tuck it behind your ears). i love your eyes when you smile and when you don't. i love the goofy smile you make whenever you see me. i love the way you smell (it's a good smell). i love your personality and how it fits perfectly with mine. i love how at the swimming carnival i was so tired and then i hung out with you for a few minutes and you refilled my energy. i love how caring and understanding you are with me. i love how no matter what you’ll still be there for me. i love when you blab about your special interests. i love when your hand is in mine. i love when i can hang out with you. i love when ellen tells me how you talk about me in english. i love how alice and ellen call us end game. i love how cool you are. i love how you immediately rushed to me when i got hit at the athletics carnival. i want to hang out with you every second of my life. i want to move away to a cottage and live with you. i want to get married to you in the cologne cathedral in germany. i want to not be afraid of expressing how much i love you. i want to spend my whole life with you. i want to introduce you to my parents. i want to kiss you so badly you dont even understand. i wish we could frolic in a field together. i wish we could have a sleepover and yap to each other about our special interests way past midnight with the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/73qFILkQuch6n3AkqAnN7f">playlist</a> playing in the background. i wish we can hang out every single day of our lives. i wish we could have classes with each other so i can hang out with you for longer.<br> 
basically what i am trying to say is i love and value you so much and i’m so happy i’ve been dating you for 3 months and i tried really hard to do this so i hope you loved it ♪(^∇^*) <br>
love from, chloe ♡ </br>
